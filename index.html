        <h3>Binomial Coefficients</h3>
        <blockquote>
            A binomial coefficient equals the number of combinations of r items that can be selected from a set of n items. It also represents an entry in Pascal's triangle. 
            These numbers are called binomial coefficients because they are coefficients in the binomial theorem.
